# covid-planet

A realtime visualisation of the Covid-19 (Corona) virus; cases & deaths.

### todo

- add credits to readme
- merge data gen with client
- yarn script to crunch fresh data (expect to run via cron)
- some description and numbers along with globe - also better positioning of the globe (use all space, and handle window resize)
